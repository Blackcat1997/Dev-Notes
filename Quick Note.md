# User Accounts
## What can users do?
### Adding
* Any page that lets a user enter and submit information on a web page is a form, even if it doesn't look like one.   
* When users enter information, we need to validate that the information is the right kind of data, and then to process and save valid information to the appropriate place in the database.
  
**ModelForm**  
The simplest way to build a form in Django is to use a ModelForm to automatically build a form.  

* create forms.py



* urls.py
* views.py
* forms.py
* .html

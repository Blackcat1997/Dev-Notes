### Repository	
* What is a repository?
A repository is usually used to organize a single project.
 
* What are there in a repository?
Folders, files, images, videos, spreadsheets, anything a project needs.
Recommend: including a README to tell the information about the project.
 
* How to create a repository?
	1. create a new repository
	2. give a name
	3. write a short description
	4. Initialize the repository with a README
 
### Branch	
* What is a branch?
Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.
By dafault, a repository has one branch named master which is considered to be the definitive branch.
 
* What do branches do?
We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to master.
 
* How does a branch work?
When you create a branch off the master branch, you’re making a copy, or snapshot, of master as it was at that point in time.
 

* How to create a branch?
	1. Go to the repository
	2. give a new branch name
	3. create done.
 
###Commit

Saved changes are called commits.
Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made.
 
* How to make and commit changes?
	1. chages some files.
	2. write a commit message.
	3. confirm commit changes.
These changes only be made to the files on the new branch created before.
 
### Pull Request
	* What is Pull Request?
After changing something in a branch off of master, we need propose the changes and let the person who we want to merge these changes to his branch review, then pull in those changes, and merge them into a branch.
 
* How does Pull Request work?
Pull requests show diffs of the both branches.
Changes and additions are shown in green
subtractions are shown in red.
 
* How to open a pull request?
	1. Create a new request
	2. Check the changes
	3. create Pull Request
	4. Set the title and a description
	5. Confirm
 
### Merge	
* What is Merge?
Merge is to bring the changes that made before in the new branch to merge into the master branch.
 
* How to merge?
	1. Click Merge Pull request
	2. Confirm merge
	3. delete the branch after merging successfully.
